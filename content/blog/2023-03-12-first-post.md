Hello! My name is Philip Emmanuele. I am an undergraduate bioengineering student at the University of California, San Diego with a passion for most things biology and much more! In my free time, I enjoy camping, hiking, running, photography, and most importantly for this blog, reading scientific papers. 

In this blog, I will be discussing papers that I read in short hand and sometimes in an informal manner. Most of these papers will be about synthetic biology, but I may stray outside of the field from time to time. Keep in mind that I am and always will be a student with much to learn, so I may make an error from time to time. Please reach out if you notice anything I should correct.

I hope to keep this blog active for a long time, but no matter which institutions I am affiliated with at the time, all opinions here are my own.
