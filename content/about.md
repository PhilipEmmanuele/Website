## Philip Emmanuele

![profile pic](/about_pic.jpg)

Hello! My name is Philip Emmanuele. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Biodynamics Lab](https://biodynamics.ucsd.edu). I am fascinated by the ways the cells work and want to learn more about tools that enable the engineering of biology. You can find the list of projects I have worked on in my resume below. In the future, I hope to become a research professor and lead my own research group.
