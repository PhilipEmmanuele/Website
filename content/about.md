## Philip Emmanuele

![profile](/content/about_pic.JPEG)

Hello! My name is Philip Emmanuele. I am an undergraduate bioengineering student at the University of California, San Diego. I am fascinated at the ways the cells work and want to learn more about cellular mechanisms to enable the engineering of biology. I currently work in the [Biodynamics Lab](https://biodynamics.ucsd.edu) as a research assistant. You can find the list of projects I have worked on in my resume below. In the future, I would love to continue to research synthetic biology and get my PhD.
