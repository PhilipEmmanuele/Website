## Philip Emmanuele

Hello! My name is Philip Emmanuele. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Biodynamics Lab](https://biodynamics.ucsd.edu) and [Cooperbacter Lab](https://coopabacter.ucsd.edu). I am fascinated by the ways the cells work and want to learn more about tools that enable the engineering of biology. You can find the list of projects I have worked on in my resume below. In the future, I hope to lead my own research group to engineer cells to optimize human health outcomes, or just to do cool stuff.
